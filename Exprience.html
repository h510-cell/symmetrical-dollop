        <h1> My Expriences</h1>
        <p>Hello!Everyone today I will tell you about my favourite expriences.
            In life I had great expriences but my favourite expriences were when When went to Pataya.
            I stayed in hotel which named Hard Rock.I loved to live in the hotel .In the hotel there 
            was a swimming pool and in the pool there was basketball for playing.Then I and family played in the pool for a long time
            I had one more exprience when I first time became captain of my basketball team.
            We won all the matches execpt the final match which was against Ujwal school and we lost the match by 1 point.
            Even if I lost I din't took it seriously and thought that I would will the final next year and then I 
            was called nashik trials  and did'nt select in the trials but I din't took it also seriously it and thought that 
            I would try it next year.Thank you.</p>
